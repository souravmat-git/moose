# Solid Isotropic Material Penalization (SIMP) Topology Optimization

While core optimization algorithms are available in the optimization module, the examples here
combine the use of such algorithms with mechanical and thermal physics. In particular, we
use SIMP to optimize single and multiple material problems. Additionally, we can optimize for
various conditions, whether they be various loads acting on a single system or various physics
acting on the same mesh domain.

All the following examples employ SIMP topology optimization (see, e.g., [!cite](sigmund200199)):
