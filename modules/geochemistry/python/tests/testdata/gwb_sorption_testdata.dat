Dataset of surface reactions for gwb programs
Dataset format: apr18
Surface type: HFO
Model type: two-layer
Surface potential: variable    (specify a value in mV to set a constant potential model)
Surface capacitance: variable  (specify a value in F/m2 to set a constant capacitance model)
Thermo dataset: thermo.tdat
*  
* 
* Reaction dataset for sorption to hydrous ferric oxide.
* 
* Based on data of Dzombak and Morel (1990), entered by Amy Berger, November 1993.
* 
* Dataset "FeOH+.dat"
* 
* This dataset contains the D&M compilation, expanded to include
*  surface complexation reactions for which binding constants have
*  only been estimated (see D&M, 1990, Chapter 10, p. 299).
* 
* Dataset FeOH.dat contains the D&M compilation in the strict sense,
*  not including the estimated values.
* 
* Reference: D.A. Dzombak, D.A. and F.F.M. Morel, 1990, Surface Complexation
*   Modeling, Hydrous Ferric Oxide.  Wiley, New York, 393 p.
* 
* This dataset is formatted for use with the "thermo.tdat" database.  To use it with
*  database "thermo.com.V8.R6+.dat", change species names as follows:
*    Fe(OH)3(ppd)  ->  Fe(OH)3
*    As(OH)3       ->  As(OH)3(aq)
*    B(OH)3        ->  B(OH)3(aq)
* 
* GWB releases 14.0 and later support bidentate and polydentate reactions according to
*  the stoichiometric, Davis-Leckie, Hiemstra-Van Reimsdijk, and Appelo-Postma conventions.
*  Refer to section "Polydentate sorption" in the GWB Essentials Guide.
* 
* GWB releases 14.0 and later accept site density values in units of either "mol/mol mineral"
*  or "sites/nm2".
