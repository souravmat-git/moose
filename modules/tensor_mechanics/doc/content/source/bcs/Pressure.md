# Pressure

!syntax description /BCs/Pressure

## Description

The boundary condition, `Pressure` applies a force to a mesh boundary in the magnitude
specified by the user.
A `component` of the normal vector to the mesh surface (0, 1, or 2 corresponding
to the $\hat{x}$, $\hat{y}$, and $\hat{z}$ vector components) is used to determine
the direction in which to apply the traction.
The boundary condition is always applied to the displaced mesh.

The magnitude of the `Pressure` boundary condition can be specified as either a
scalar (use the input parameter `factor`), a `function` parameter, or a `Postprocessor`
name.

!alert note title=Can Be Created with the Pressure Action
A set of +`Pressure`+ boundary conditions applied to multiple variables in multiple
components can be defined with the [PressureAction](/BCs/Pressure/index.md).
