# BilinearMixedModeCohesiveZoneModel

## Description

The `BilinearMixedModeCohesiveZoneModel` object computes a global traction vector
from a local traction vector that is calculated from a bilinear mixed mode cohesive
zone model. Theoretical equations and their application to particle fuel is described
and discussed in [!cite](jiang2021efficient).

This object inherits from [PenaltySimpleCohesiveZoneModel](/PenaltySimpleCohesiveZoneModel.md)
and can include penalty mortar mechanical contact.

This object implements the bilinear mixed mode traction separation law using the nodal-based mortar quantities
that are employed in the MOOSE formulation. Such quantities are identified with a tilde
at a secondary surface node $j$. The definitions of mortar surfaces and mortar quantities are identical to
those presented in previous technical reports ([!cite](martin2022implement,recuero2022mortar)),
which are in turn based on existing discretization approaches ([!cite](wohlmuth2011variationally,
puso2008segment)).


### Quadratic failure criterion

The softening of the interface in the bilinear mixed mode traction separation law is given by a quadratic failure criterion. The onset of softening of the interface takes place when the traction state reaches the following equality:
\begin{equation}
    {\left(\frac{<{\tilde{\sigma}_{N,j}}>}{N}\right)}^{2} + {\left(\frac{{\tilde{\tau}_{1,j}}}{T_{1}}\right)}^{2} + {\left(\frac{{\tilde{\tau}_{2,j}}}{T_{2}}\right)}^{2} = 1.0,
    \label{eq:tsl_softening}
\end{equation}
where $<{\tilde{\sigma}_{N,j}}>$, $\tilde{\tau}_{1,j}$, and $\tilde{\tau}_{2,j}$ are the (positive) normal traction, the shear traction along direction one, and the shear traction along direction two, respectively. These three traction components are computed at each node $j$ using interpolated, weighted quantities. $N$, $T_{1}$, and $T_{2}$ are the interlaminar tensile and shear strengths, which are model parameters.

### Mode mixity

The displacement on the interface can be split into normal and tangential parts. Therefore, the mixed mode relative displacement can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\delta}_{m,j} = \sqrt{\tilde{\delta}_{t1,j}^{2} + \tilde{\delta}_{t2,j}^{2} + \langle{\tilde{\delta}_{N,j}\rangle}^{2}},
  \label{eq:mixed_disp}
\end{equation}
where subscripts $N$, and $t1$ and $t2$ denote the normal direction and the two tangential directions, respectively.

The formulation assumes that the interface traction generated by the displacements is proportional; in essence, a traction component is equal to a penalty factor times the displacement jump component ($\tau_{i} = K_{i}\delta_{i}$, where $K_{i}$ is the penalty factor). If $\tilde{\delta}_{N,j} \leq 0$, the mixity ratio is obtained as:
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\beta} = \frac{\sqrt{\tilde{\delta}_{t1,j}^{2} + \tilde{\delta}_{t2,j}^{2}}}{\tilde{\delta}_{N,j}}.
  \label{eq:mixity_ratio}
\end{equation}

Assuming $T_1 = T_2$, the uni-mode relative displacements at the beginning of softening (denoted by superscript ``0'') are given by:
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{\delta}_{ti,j}^{0} = \frac{T_{i}}{K_{i}},\,  \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} = \frac{N}{K_{i}}.
  \label{eq:rel_disp}
\end{equation}

The mixed mode relative displacement corresponding to the initiation of softening, $\tilde{\delta}_{m,j}^{0}$, is defined by the following multi-part definition:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\delta}_{m,j}^{0} =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		\tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} \tilde{\delta}_{t2,j}^{0} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \tilde{\beta}^{2}}{\tilde{(\delta}_{t2,j}^{0})^2 + (\tilde{\beta} \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0})^2}}  &  {if } \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} \geq 0, \\
		\tilde{\delta}_{t2,j}^{0}  &  {if } \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0}  < 0.
	\end{array}
\right.
    \label{eq:mix_mode_rel_disp}
\end{equation}

### Mode mixity Delamination propagation prediction

The new CZM mortar implementation also accounts for two types of delamination propagation models. (1) A power law-based criterion and (2) The Benzeggagh-Kenane (BK) criterion (see, e.g.,[!cite](benzeggagh1996measurement,bui2011modified)).

#### Power law-based delamination criterion

The power law criterion may be described as:
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{G_{I}}{G_{IC}}\right)^{\alpha} + \left(\frac{G_{II}}{G_{IIC}}\right)^{\alpha} = 1.0,
\label{eq:power_law_crit}
\end{equation}
where $G_{I}$ and $G_{II}$ are the critical energy release rates for mixed modes; whereas $G_{IC}$ and $G_{IIC}$ are the critical energy release rates for pure modes. The power exponent $\alpha$ is can be obtained experimentally.

During the delamination or debonding process, a relative interface displacement may be reached such that cohesive fores completely disappear, i.e. the cohesive model ceases to influence boundary tractions. Such a mixed-mode displacement value is defined as follows (note that we carry the node-wise definition, $j$):
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\delta}_{m,j}^{f} =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		\frac{2(1+\tilde{\beta}^{2})}{K \tilde{\delta}_{m,j}^{0}} \left[\left( \frac{1}{G_{IC}}\right)^{\alpha} + \left( \frac{\tilde{\beta}^{2}}{G_{IIC}}\right)^{\alpha}\right]^{\frac{-1}{\alpha}}   &  {if } \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} \geq 0, \\
		\sqrt{\tilde{\delta}_{1,j}^{f} + \tilde{\delta}_{2,j}^{f}}  &  {if } \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} < 0.
	\end{array}
\right.
    \label{eq:mix_mode_decohesion}
\end{equation}

#### Benzeggagh-Kenane (BK) delamination criterion

The BK criterion can be written as ([!cite](benzeggagh1996measurement)):
\begin{equation}
G_{TC} = G_{IC} + (G_{IIC} - G_{IC}) (\frac{G_{II}}{G_{T}})^{\eta},
\label{eq:bk_criterion}
\end{equation}
where $G_{T} = G_{I} + G_{II}$, $G_{TC}$ is the total critical strain energy release rate, and $\eta$ is a model parameter.

The mixed-mode total decohesion displacements are, for the BK criterion:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\delta}_{m,j}^{f} =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		\frac{2}{K \tilde{\delta}_{m,j}^{0}} \left[ G_{IC} + \left(G_{IIC} - G_{IC}\left[\frac{\tilde{\beta}^{2}}{1 + \tilde{\beta}^{2}}\right]^{\eta}\right)\right]   &  {if } \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} \geq 0, \\
		\sqrt{\tilde{\delta}_{1,j}^{f} + \tilde{\delta}_{2,j}^{f}}  &  {if } \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} < 0.
	\end{array}
\right.
    \label{eq:bk_mix_mode_decohesion}
\end{equation}

### Constitutive model

The CZM constitutive models relate the weighted interface jump components to the interface traction in the local frame of reference. The traction, in the local frame of reference, can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{l} = D_{li} \tilde{\delta}_{i},
\label{eq:traction}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{l}$ is the $l$ component of the local traction and $D_{li}$ is an effective stiffness. The constitutive components are computed as:
\begin{equation}
 \tau_{l} =
\left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		(1 - \omega) K \tilde{\delta}_{\text{active}}  &  {if } \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} \geq 0, \\
		K \tilde{\delta}_{\text{inactive}}  &  {if } \tilde{\delta}_{N,j}^{0} < 0,
	\end{array}
\right.
\label{eq:constitutive}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\delta}_{\text{active}}$ represents the CZM weighted interface jump with shear components, i.e. it applies shear stiffness, and normal stiffness only if a gap exists. $\tilde{\delta}_{\text{inactive}}$ applies a normal traction that prevents interpenetration. A few notes about the previous equation:

  - The action of $\delta_{\text{inactive}}$ can potentially be replaced with (mortar) mechanical contact enforcement. \\
  - The local traction $\tau_{l}$ is computed nodally with weighted quantities, but is interpolated and applied on the primary and secondary surfaces using Lagrange interpolation functions. \\
  - The constitutive model can be expanded as needed in the user object.

The damage, $\omega$, is computed as follows (we omit the nodal subscript):
\begin{equation}
\omega = \frac{\tilde{\delta}_{m}^{f} \left( \tilde{\delta}_{m}^{\text{max}} - \tilde{\delta}_{m}^{0}\right)}{\tilde{\delta}_{m}^{\text{max}} \left( \tilde{\delta}_{m}^{f} - \tilde{\delta}_{m}^{0}\right)}.
\end{equation}

### Viscous regularization

Sudden degradation of stiffness may be give rise to the appearance of large displacements. To alleviate this problematic numerical behavior in quasti-static simulations, we include in the constitutive equations a viscous damage $\omega_{v}$ instead:
\begin{equation}
\dot{\omega}_{v} = \frac{1}{\mu} \left( \omega - \omega_v\right).
\end{equation}
