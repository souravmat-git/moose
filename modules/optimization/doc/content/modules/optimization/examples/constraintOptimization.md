# Constrained Optimization Examples

In a constrained optimization problem, we use optimization to minimize the
objective function while satisfying inequality or equality constraints.
Examples for the following constrained optimization problems are given on the below pages:

- [Example 1: Shape Optimization with Volume Constraints](shapeOpt_Annulus.md)
- [debuggingHelp.md]
