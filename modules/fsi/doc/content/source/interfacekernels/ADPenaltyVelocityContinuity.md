# ADPenaltyVelocityContinuity

!syntax description /InterfaceKernels/ADPenaltyVelocityContinuity

This object is meant for use in coupling the Navier-Stokes fluid equations with
solid mechanics equations at a fluid-structure interface. In that context this
object imposes both continuity of stress and continuity of material velocity via
a penalty condition. For more information on the error of penalty methods,
please see [CoupledPenaltyInterfaceDiffusion.md].
