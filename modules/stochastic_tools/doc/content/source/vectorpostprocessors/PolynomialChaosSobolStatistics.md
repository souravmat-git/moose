# PolynomialChaosSobolStatistics

!syntax description /VectorPostprocessors/PolynomialChaosSobolStatistics

## Overview

This object computes Sobol sensitivity indices based on a trained [PolynomialChaos.md] surrogate model. The alogrithm is based on computations described in [!cite](sudret2008global). The sensitivities to be computed are defined by the input parameter [!param](/VectorPostprocessors/PolynomialChaosSobolStatistics/sensitivity_order): `first` computes first-order sensitivities, `second` computes second-order sensitivities, `all` computes all sensitivities (replacing `first` and `second`), and `total` comutes the total sensitivities.

## Example Syntax

The following input snippet uses the GFunction test object, which is defined as:

!equation
g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n\frac{|4x_i-2|+q_i}{1+q_i},

where $\vec{q}$ is defined in the input file, $x$ is the vector of model data, and $n$ is the number
of input variables. The $x$ data is generated by QuadratureSampler object.

!listing poly_chaos/sobol.i block=VectorPostprocessors

## Example Output

The resulting output contains a single column of all the sensitivities and columnes containing the indicies. The column `i_T` is the total sensitivity index, `i_1` is the first index, `i_2` second, and so on to `i_n`. For sensitivity orders less than $n$, the last index is repeated and can be ignored.
