# This simulation uses the piece-wise strain hardening model
# with the Finite strain formulation.
#
# This test applies a repeated displacement loading and unloading condition on
# the top in the y direction. The material deforms elastically until the
# loading reaches the initial yield point and then plastic deformation starts.
#
# The yield surface begins to translate as stress increases, but its size
# remains the same. The backstress evolves with plastic strain to capture
# this translation. Upon unloading, the stress reverses direction, and material
# first behaves elastically. However, due to the translation of the yield surface
# the yield point in the reverse direction is lower.
#
# If the reverse load is strong enough, the material will yield in the reverse
# direction, which models the Bauschinger effect(reduction in yield stress in
# the opposite direction).
#
# This test is based on the similar response obtained for a prescribed non symmetrical
# stress path in Besson, Jacques, et al. Non-linear mechanics of materials. Vol. 167.
# Springer Science & Business Media, 2009  pg. 89 fig. 3.6(b). This SolidMechanics code
# matches the SolidMechanics solution.
