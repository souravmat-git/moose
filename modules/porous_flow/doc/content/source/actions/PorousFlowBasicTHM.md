# PorousFlowBasicTHM

This action allows simple simulation of fully-saturated, single-phase,
single-component fluid flow.  The fluid flow may be optionally coupled
to mechanics and/or heat flow using the `coupling_type` flag.

The fluid equation is a *simplified* form of the full [PorousFlow fluid equation](/porous_flow/governing_equations.md) (see [PorousFlowFullySaturatedMassTimeDerivative](/PorousFlowFullySaturatedMassTimeDerivative.md) and [PorousFlowFullySaturatedDarcyBase](/PorousFlowFullySaturatedDarcyBase.md) for the derivation):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:basicthm}
0 = (\rho)\left(\frac{\dot{P}}{M} + \alpha_{B}\dot{\epsilon}_{v} - A\dot{T}\right) -
\nabla_{i}\left((\rho) k_{ij}\left(\nabla_{j}P - \rho g_{j}\right)/\mu\right)
\ .
\end{equation}
Note that the fluid-mass time derivative is close to linear, and is perfectly linear if `multiply_by_density=false`, and this also almost linearises the flow term.  Extremely good nonlinear convergence should therefore be expected, but there are some knock-on effects that are documented in [PorousFlowFullySaturatedMassTimeDerivative](/PorousFlowFullySaturatedMassTimeDerivative.md).

In fully-saturated, single-phase simulations [upwinding](/porous_flow/upwinding.md)
is typically unnecessary.  Moreover, the standard PorousFlow Kernels
are somewhat inefficient in the fully-saturated case since Material
Properties such as relative permeabilities and saturations actually do
not need to be computed.

In fully-saturated, single-phase, single-component simulations, the
[mass lumping](/porous_flow/mass_lumping.md) is also typically unncessary.  More
importantly, in many real-life situations, as may be seen in
[eq:basicthm] the time derivative of the fluid mass may be linearised,
which leads to improved convergence.

To simulate [eq:basicthm] the `PorousFlowBasicTHM` Action employs the following Kernels:

- [PorousFlowFullySaturatedMassTimeDerivative](/PorousFlowFullySaturatedMassTimeDerivative.md), if the simulation is of Transient type.
- [PorousFlowFullySaturatedDarcyBase](/PorousFlowFullySaturatedDarcyBase.md)

For isothermal simulations, the fluid properties may still depend on temperature, so the `temperature` input parameter may be set to any real number, or to an AuxVariable if desired.

For anisothermal simulations, the energy equation reads
\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left((1-\phi)\rho_{R}C_{R}T + \phi\rho\mathcal{E}\right) - \nabla\cdot (\rho h k(\nabla P - \rho \mathbf{g})/\mu) - \nabla\cdot(\lambda \nabla T) + \left((1-\phi)\rho_{R}C_{R}T + \phi\rho\mathcal{E}\right)\nabla\cdot v_{s} \ ,
\end{equation}
where the final term is only used if coupling with mechanics is also desired.  To simulate this DE, `PorousFlowBasicTHM` uses the following kernels:

- [PorousFlowEnergyTimeDerivative](/PorousFlowEnergyTimeDerivative.md) if the simulation is of Transient type
- [PorousFlowFullySaturatedHeatAdvection](/PorousFlowFullySaturatedHeatAdvection.md) with `multiply_by_density=true` (irrespective of the setting of this flag in the `PorousflowBasicTHM` Action)
- [PorousFlowHeatConduction](/PorousFlowHeatConduction.md)
- [PorousFlowHeatVolumetricExpansion](/PorousFlowHeatVolumetricExpansion.md) if coupling with temperature and mechanics is desired, and if the simulation is of Transient type

For simulations that couple fluid flow to mechanics, the equations are already written in [governing equations](/porous_flow/governing_equations.md), and `PorousFlowBasicTHM` implements these by using the following kernels:

- [StressDivergenceTensors](/StressDivergenceTensors.md)
- [Gravity](/Gravity.md)
- [PorousFlowEffectiveStressCoupling](/PorousFlowEffectiveStressCoupling.md)

`PorousFlowBasicTHM` adds many Materials automatically, however, to run a simulation you will need to provide more Materials for each mesh block, depending on your simulation type, viz:

- One of the `PorousFlowPermeability` classes, eg [PorousFlowPermeabilityConst](PorousFlowPermeabilityConst.md)
- [PorousFlowConstantBiotModulus](/PorousFlowConstantBiotModulus.md)
- [PorousFlowConstantThermalExpansionCoefficient](/PorousFlowConstantThermalExpansionCoefficient.md)
- [PorousFlowPorosity](/PorousFlowPorosity.md)
- [PorousFlowMatrixInternalEnergy](/PorousFlowMatrixInternalEnergy.md)
- A thermal conductivity calculator, eg [PorousFlowThermalConductivityIdeal](/PorousFlowThermalConductivityIdeal.md)
- An elasticity tensor, eg, [ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor](/ComputeIsotropicElasticityTensor.md)
- A strain calculator, eg, [ComputeSmallStrain](/ComputeSmallStrain.md)
- A thermal expansion eigenstrain calculator, eg, [ComputeThermalExpansionEigenstrain](/ComputeThermalExpansionEigenstrain.md)
- A stress calculator, eg [ComputeLinearElasticStress](/ComputeLinearElasticStress.md)

!alert note
Since upwinding and no mass lumping of the fluid mass are used (for simplicity, efficiency and to reduce [numerical diffusion](/porous_flow/numerical_diffusion.md)), the results may be slightly different to simulations that employ upwinding and mass lumping.
