## MOOSE Improvements

### Specific internal energy added to Solid Properties objects

The [ThermalSolidProperties.md] objects from the [Solid properties module](modules/solid_properties/index.md)
now provide interfaces to compute the specific internal energy as a function of
temperature. This new interface is useful, for example, in measuring the
internal energy in solids for energy conservation verification.
