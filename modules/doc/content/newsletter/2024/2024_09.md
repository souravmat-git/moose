## MOOSE Improvements

### Specific internal energy added to Solid Properties objects

The [ThermalSolidProperties.md] objects from the [Solid properties module](modules/solid_properties/index.md)
now provide interfaces to compute the specific internal energy as a function of
temperature. This new interface is useful, for example, in measuring the
internal energy in solids for energy conservation verification.

### Exit Code Management

The ability was added to allow an application to set its exit code, which can
be seen in `MooseApp::setExitCode()`. This feature was added in order to better
support instances in which you want to run an external process within an application,
as the proper return code from the external process can be captured and
returned via your application.

In order for an application properly return this exit code, a modification is needed
within the `main` function. To do this, modify the `main()` function in `src/main.C`
to look like the following:

```
int
main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
  return Moose::main<YourApp>(argc, argv);
}
```

where `YourApp` is the class for your application.

This change should be made as soon as possible as the logic that was changed here
impacts the application command line options `--run` and `--copy-inputs` used for
executing installed MOOSE applications.
