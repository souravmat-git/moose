## MOOSE Improvements

### Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin methods

We have added the ability to implement hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)
methods. Thus far, we have added HDG discretizations of diffusion and
Navier-Stokes physics. For more information about HDG, please visit the
[HDG overview page](HDGKernels/index.md). More information about HDG
Navier-Stokes can be accessed [here](NavierStokesHDGKernel.md).

### Add new linear system assembly for finite volume methods

We have added a new assembly algorithm for finite volume systems which does not rely on 
Newton's method. With the new interfaces, the developer can decide which fixed-point algorithm 
is needed for a given problem and implement matrix and right hand side contributions accordingly. 
The current examples in MOOSE asssume a Picard-style fixed-point iteration. 
For more information we refer the interested reader to the [design page](linear_fv_design.md).

### Override parameters when using included files

Either of following syntaxes can now be used to override parameters from included files:

```
param := value
param :override= value
```

See [Parameter override syntax](application_usage/input_syntax.md) for more information.

### Added radiation coupling component between multiple 2D heat structures

In the [Thermal hydraulics module](modules/thermal_hydraulics/index.md), the
component [HSCoupler2D2DRadiation.md] was added, which couples any number of
2D heat structures together via radiation, using gray, diffuse assumptions.

### Deployment of the Physics syntax to the Navier Stokes module

Several [Physics](Physics/index.md) actions were created for the Navier Stokes equation
with a finite volume discretization, and the fully-coupled single matrix approach.

- [WCNSFVFlowPhysics.md] for the mass and momentum equation
- [WCNSFVFluidHeatTransferPhysics.md] for the fluid energy equation
- [WCNSFVScalarTransportPhysics.md] for the transport of scalar quantities
- [WCNSFVTurbulencePhysics.md] for turbulence models
- [PNSFVSolidHeatTransferPhysics.md] for the porous media solid phase energy equation

### Deployment of the new linear system assembly approach for the SIMPLE algorithm in the Navier Stokes module

We have deployed the new linear system assembly approach for building the momentum and pressure 
systems in the [SIMPLE.md] algorithm within the Navier Stokes module of MOOSE. 
On a 3D wavy pipe problem with around 330,000-cell unstructured hex mesh, 
the new approach shows a speedup of a factor of 10 in terms of solve times compared 
to the previous approach which relied in the residual and Jacobian routines 
already available in MOOSE.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2024.05.05` Update

- `ShellMatrix` support and other functionality added to
  `CondensedEigenSystem`, to allow applications like MOOSE to safely
  solve eigenproblems with adaptive refinement or other DoF constraint
  equations
- Added `SparseMatrix::read()` subroutine, as well as format-specific
  read subroutines, to read sparse matrices from files.
- Added gzip option to mesh splitter app output
- Auto Area function options for triangulation, allowing MOOSE
  `XYDelaunay` users to more easily generate more smoothly graded
  meshes
- Moved eigensolve printing and error computation from dbg-mode-only
  to a new `print_eigenvalues()` routine
- Using more modern C++ features to simplify code:
  `std::insert_or_assign`, `if` statements with variable initializers,
  reliable implicit polymorphic `unique_ptr` conversion, more use of
  `std::make_unique` and smart pointers to replace raw `new`,
- Doxygen documentation clarifications
- More test coverage for PDE solves in spaces defined by arbitrary
  constraint operators
- Debug-mode testing of partitioner graph symmetry, to intercept
  any errors before Parmetis can turn them into a more obscure error
- Assorted Reduced Basis code updates: virtual `preevaluate_thetas()`
  method to allow subclass overrides; overruling of
  `deterministic_training` option in some cases; storing error
  indicator normalization
