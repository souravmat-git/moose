## MOOSE Improvements

### General axisymmetric coordinates

The `RZ` coordinate system was extended to enable using general coordinate axes.
Before this, the `RZ` coordinate system was limited in the following ways:

- The origin of the coordinate system was restricted to be $(0,0,0)$ only.
- The direction of the axisymmetric axis was restricted to be the $\hat{x}$ or $\hat{y}$ direction.
- Only a single axisymmetric coordinate system could be defined.

Now arbitrary axisymmetric coordinate systems may be specified on a
per-subdomain basis: for each subdomain using `RZ`, the axis origin and
direction are specified. See [Mesh/index.md#coordinate_systems] for more
information.

### Added HSCoupler2D3D component

The [HSCoupler2D3D.md] component was added to the
[Thermal Hydraulics module](modules/thermal_hydraulics/index.md). This component
fully couples a 2D heat structure boundary to a 3D heat structure boundary
via a simplified gap heat transfer formulation. Using this component can avoid
the need to create [MultiApps](MultiApps/index.md) for simulations solving
transient heat conduction between a 3D domain like an assembly matrix and
2D heat structure components. The main caveat is that the application needs to
be configured with a sufficient [AD](automatic_differentiation/index.md)
container size, due to coupling 2D elements to arbitrary numbers of 3D elements.
See the component documentation for more information.
