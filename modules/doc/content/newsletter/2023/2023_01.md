## MOOSE Improvements

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2023.01.09` Update

- Added `Elem::orient()` method, to automatically reorder "flipped"
  elements that would otherwise have a negative Jacobian.
- Added `MeshTools::Modification::orient_elements()` method, to
  automatically reorder any and all "flipped" elements in an entire
  mesh.
- Changed `GhostingFunctor::map_type` definition, to shorten +
  optimize `SparsityPattern` construction code.  Typical matrix
  initialization speed is unchanged, common initialization cases are
  approximately 50% faster, and worst-case initialization benchmarks
  are 800% faster.
- libMesh now only prints its own error messages from exceptions which
  are not caught.  Higher-level code catching error exceptions can
  choose whether to print their messages or not.
- Mesh refinement support for Prism21 elements
- `SIDE_HIERARCHIC` finite element support for prisms, higher shape
  function orders on hexes
- Added `Pyramid18` geometry and `Lagrange` basis support
- Nemesis files now support named blocks, sidesets, and nodesets
- Added a flag to control whether nodal quadrature is allowed in pyramids
- Compatibility fixes for MFFD with PETSc 3.18.1
- Replaced deprecated-by-OSX `sprintf()` calls with proper C++
- Added `NodeElem` implementations for `contains_point()` and
  `close_to_point()`
- Added `PetscVector::pointwise_divide()`
- `Xdr` now accepts any `std::string_view` compatible comment
- Bug fixes for Abaqus I/O, Tri7 refinement, `L2_HIERARCHIC` shapes on
  Tri3, and an unnecessary header inclusion
