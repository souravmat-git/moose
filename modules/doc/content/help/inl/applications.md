[!ac](INL) develops a large number of MOOSE-based applications. These applications are typically
focused on nuclear energy, but has MOOSE and [!ac](INL) simulation capabilities continue to grow the
breadth of applications continues to expand as well. The following sections highlight some of the
[!ac](INL) developed applications.
