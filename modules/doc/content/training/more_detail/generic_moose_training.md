The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) Workshop provides an in-depth
introduction to the framework. The course is 2.5 days in length and covers material starting from
the mathematical underpinnings of the framework through advanced features of the MOOSE Multiapps
system. The course uses a realistic multiphysics problem that is solved with increasing realism and
complexity utilizing the many pluggable systems in the framework. Hands on exercises are supplied so
attendees are encouraged to bring their own hardware to participate.
