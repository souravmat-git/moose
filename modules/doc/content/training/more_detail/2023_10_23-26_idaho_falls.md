#### Fellowship Programmeâ€”MOOSE Modeling and Simulation of Advanced Reactors

!style! halign=left
The workshop will focus on the modeling and simulation of nuclear fuels, neutronics, and thermal
hydraulics, through the lens of the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE)
computational framework and applications build using it.  The workshop will culminate with example
simulations of coupled-physics simulations of advanced reactor designs.
