!syntax description /Positions/HexagonalGridPositions

Certain pins may be excluded using the [!param](/Positions/HexagonalGridPositions/pattern)
and [!param](/Positions/HexagonalGridPositions/include_in_pattern)
parameter. The last two `HexagonalGridPositions` objects created in the following snippet
display this feature by excluding the '2' or the '3' positions in the pattern.
Note that the pattern is rotated 30 degrees clockwise in the positions created.
