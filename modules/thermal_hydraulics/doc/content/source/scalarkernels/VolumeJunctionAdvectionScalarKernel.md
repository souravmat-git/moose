# VolumeJunctionAdvectionScalarKernel

!syntax description /ScalarKernels/VolumeJunctionAdvectionScalarKernel

This scalar kernel was formerly used by the [/VolumeJunction1Phase.md] component. It was
used on all of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with the junction model.

This scalar kernel retrieves the computed residuals and Jacobians from the
[/ADVolumeJunction1PhaseUserObject.md].
