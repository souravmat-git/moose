   abstract = {Uranium carbides are receiving renewed interest as a preferred nuclear fuel composition for advanced reactors due to their numerous favorable properties. Like many other refractory and transition metal carbides these compounds exist in both hypo- and hyper-stoichiometric compositions which results in significant variations in physical, thermal, and mechanical properties. This manuscript surveys both historic and recent literature to compile important properties data mainly as a function of temperature and carbon content to support fuel performance modeling. Expressions and fits for such properties are also suggested when allowed by complete data sets. The manuscript also attempts to highlight gaps and discrepancies in the reported data to assist the nuclear fuels community identify key areas that may require further attention in terms of future research and development.},

   abstract = {A resource for reactor physicists and engineers and students of nuclear power engineering, this publication provides a comprehensive summary of the thermophysical properties data needed in nuclear power engineering. It includes data for nuclear fuels (metallic and ceramic), coolants (gases, light water, heavy water and liquid metals), moderators, absorbers and structural materials. The correlations and equations provided allow for the estimation of all important thermodynamic and transport properties. The detailed material properties of both solid and liquid states are shown in tabular form. The data on thermophysical properties of saturated vapors of some metals are also given.--Publisher's description.
