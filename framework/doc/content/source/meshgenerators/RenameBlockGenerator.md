# RenameBlockGenerator

!syntax description /MeshGenerators/RenameBlockGenerator

## Overview

`RenameBlockGenerator` is usually used to provide meaningful names to blocks so that input files are easier to
read.  For instance

```text
old_block_id = '1 2 3'
new_block_name = 'wheel engine axle'
```

Then the MOOSE input file can employ `block = wheel` rather than `block = 1`.  `RenameBlockGenerator` may also
be to provide more meaningful names to mesh blocks that are already named.  For instance

```text
old_block_name = 'silly meaningless crazy'
new_block_name = 'wheel engine axle'
```

Then the MOOSE input file can employ `block = axle` rather than `block = crazy`.

!alert warning
`RenameBlockGenerator` may also be used to merge blocks, but care must be taken.

For instance

```
old_block_id = '1 2 3'
new_block_id = '4 4 4'
```

Then blocks 1, 2 and 3 will be merged together into one block that may be used in the remainder of
the input file.  However, when merging blocks problems and even inconsistencies can occur.

Firstly, in the example just given, what if the blocks 1, 2 and 3 were named?  What should the name
of the block 4 be?  The convention is that it is the name of the first old block that is given the
block ID of 4, which is the name of the old block 1 in this case.  The user needs to be aware of this
convention.  Similarly, if `old_block_name = 'oldA oldB'` and `new_block_name = 'new1 new1'`, then
the block ID of new1 is the block ID of oldA.

Secondly, in the example above, what if block 4 already existed?  An inconsistency could arise in the
input file, because block 4 is now given the name of the old block 1.

Thirdly, in this example `old_block_id = '1 2'` and `new_block_name = 'wheel wheel'`. What if another
block, with a different ID, already had the name "wheel"?  This can lead to great confusion in the MOOSE input file.

!alert note
Given all these potential problems, when merging blocks it is strongly recommended to use just
*one* `RenameBlock` that includes the names or IDs of *all* the blocks involved in the merging.
This will make the new block IDs and new block names unequivocally obvious.
