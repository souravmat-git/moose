# BlockDeletionGenerator

!syntax description /MeshGenerators/BlockDeletionGenerator

## Overview

The BlockDeletionGenerator is used to remove elements from a mesh matching a
user provided subdomain ID. While most mesh generation operations should be
based on geometric operations, it is sometimes easier to remove discretized
elements for certain problems.
