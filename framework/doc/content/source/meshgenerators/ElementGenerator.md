# ElementGenerator

!syntax description /MeshGenerators/ElementGenerator

## Overview

This MeshGenerator object allows the user to create a single element (it is possible to create a simple mesh by adding elements one by one).

The user has to provide the positions of the nodes for his element, as well as the type of element he wants (QUAD4, TRI3,...) and the element node connectivity.
