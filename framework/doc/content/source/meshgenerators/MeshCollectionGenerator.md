# MeshCollectionGenerator

!syntax description /MeshGenerators/MeshCollectionGenerator

## Overview

The `MeshCollectionGenerator` creates a new mesh that is a collection of
sub-meshes (provided in the `inputs` parameter). The sub-meshes are not linked in
any way and interaction between them only occurs due to contact or other
constraints.
