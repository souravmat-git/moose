# TimeSequenceFromTimes

!syntax description /Executioner/TimeSteppers/TimeSequenceFromTimes

The time sequence of times to hit is retrieved every time the time stepper is asked to step in
time. This lets the times to hit evolve dynamically if the times in the [Times](syntax/Times/index.md)
object are changing.
